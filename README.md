### Welcome to the Propensity Score Matching and Data Mining Project

Hello,

Welcome to my repository! Here, we will explore and implement techniques related to propensity score matching and data mining. This project aims to combine statistical methods with data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

#### *Project Objectives:*

1. *Propensity Score Matching (PSM):*
   - Propensity score matching is a statistical technique used to estimate the effect of a treatment by accounting for the covariates that predict receiving the treatment. 
   - We will cover the basics of propensity score calculation, matching algorithms, and evaluating the balance between treated and control groups.
   
2. *Data Mining:*
   - Data mining involves extracting useful information from large datasets using various methods such as clustering, classification, and association rule mining.
   - We will apply data mining techniques to our matched datasets to discover patterns, trends, and insights that could drive decision-making
